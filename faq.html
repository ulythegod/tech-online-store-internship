                    from Shop, the Customer agrees that it is bound by these Terms and 
                    Conditions of sale. Customer orders, including orders placed via 
                    the internet, are subject to acceptance by Shop. The acceptance 
                    of the Customer's order by Shop is expressly made conditional 
                    upon the Customer's assent to these Terms and Conditions which 
                    will prevail notwithstanding anything that may be stated to the 
                    contrary on the Customer's order. Shop reserves the right to vary 
                    any of these terms at any time and any subsequent orders placed by 
                    the Customer will constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied. 
                    Once a Customer order has been placed and accepted by Shop, the 
                    Customer agrees that the Customer has no right to cancel or vary 
                    the order at any time, unless agreed upon in writing by both parties.

                    the Customer within the period stated in the quotation or, where no 
                    period is stated, within seven (7) days from the date of the quotation.

                    Credit Card Payments may attract a surcharge, and Shop will inform the Customer 
                    if this is to be the case before processing the transaction.<br>
                    Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Shop, where Shop has not agreed in writing 
                    to provide commercial credit to the Customer, the total purchase price for 
                    Products supplied will be due for payment in cash prior to delivery.<br>
                    Where Shop has agreed in writing to provide commercial credit to the Customer, 
                    the Customer must make payments in accordance with the payment terms provided 
                    by Shop.<br>

                    the Customer must pay the total purchase price for Products supplied within 
                    seven days of the statement date.<br>
                    Credit Card Payment at an Invoice or transaction level may also be offered 
                    to the Customer as a stand-alone payment method, or in conjunction with

                    will continue until terminated by Shop at it sole discretion. In the event 
                    that Shop terminates the Customer's commercial credit arrangement, the 
                    Customer will be notified in writing and termination will take effect 
                    upon receipt of that notification by the Customer.

                <p>
                    Trading accounts are approved by Shop based on the information supplied and 
                    the representations made by the Customer. In the event that there is a change 
                    in ownership of the Customer, whether total or partial, the Customer must 
                    immediately provide written notice to Shop informing Shop of these changes. 
                    Until Shop receives written notice from the Customer of a change in ownership, 
                    the Customer (including where it is a company or trustee, each of the Directors 
                    thereof) holds Shop indemnified against any and all losses, unpaid accounts, 
                    interest, damages, costs, charges, fees and expenses incurred or suffered by 
                    Shop in trading with any person, company (including the same company but with 
                    a different shareholder or shareholders) or other entity (including a trust) 
                    which may have purchased the Customer's business or any interest in the Customer's 
                    business or any of the shares in the Customer and used the Customer's previously 
                    approved account for trading.<br>
                    Where a Customer has been authorised by Shop to make payments through Credit Card 
                    Direct Debit, the Customer must provide notice in writing at least five (5) days 
                    prior to any change in ownership of the business to allow Shop sufficient time 
                    to contact the new owner to obtain and confirm new Credit Card information if 
                    applicable.

                    Shop reserves the right to deliver Products in part deliveries. In the event that 
                    Shop incurs additional costs for meeting special (i.e. Tasmania / Northern Territory 
                    Deliveries) or urgent delivery arrangements, these additional costs may be charged 
                    to the Customer and may include the cost of airfreight where it is not the normal 
                    method of delivery. The Customer agrees to accept delivery of the Products sold

                    Shop will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from any late delivery

                    repudiate the Customer's order for the Products.
